# Server Management for Employee Time Tracking

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "employee_time_tracking".
2. Inside "employee_time_tracking", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files for tracking daily work hours (e.g., "employee_1_hours.txt", "employee_2_hours.txt") and time logs (e.g., "time_log.txt").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move an employee's time tracking file (e.g., "employee_1_hours.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a time log file (e.g., "time_log.txt" to "time_log_updated.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "employee_time_tracking" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant employee time logs and data files.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "employee_data.txt" in the "employee_time_tracking" directory to store confidential time tracking information.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized HR personnel or administrators can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized personnel can access or modify the file.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of an important time tracking file (e.g., "employee_1_hours.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the employee's time tracking file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated or incorrect time tracking file (e.g., "employee_2_hours_old.txt") in the "employee_time_tracking" directory that is no longer required.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it contains no time tracking data).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 time tracking files (e.g., "employee_1_hours_1.txt", "employee_1_hours_2.txt") in the "employee_time_tracking" directory to simulate employee work hour logs.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to employee time tracking operations, such as log creation, data updates, or file management.
2. Search the history for any command related to time log management or file modification.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the time tracking server has been continuously running and processing employee time logs.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server has enough resources (CPU, memory) to handle the number of employees' time tracking data efficiently.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "employee_data.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized users or administrators can modify or access the time tracking data.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server to ensure that the time tracking server can reliably access and update employee time data across networks.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is minimal for fast data retrieval and synchronization of time logs.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific employee's time tracking file (e.g., "employee_1_hours.txt") within the "employee_time_tracking" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "hours worked:") inside one of the time log files to identify the hours worked by an employee on a particular day.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each employee in your system (e.g., "employee_1", "employee_2") to store their respective time logs and tracking data.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective employee and HR staff can modify or access their time tracking data.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "employee_time_tracking" directory to keep the system organized and remove any unnecessary data from inactive months.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the time tracking files in a directory by size or date and list the files based on their size or modification date.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest time tracking files, helping you identify any outliers or potential errors in data recording.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., text files, CSV files) in the "employee_time_tracking" directory to streamline management and storage of time tracking data.
2. Filter and list time log files based on their format (e.g., only CSV or text files) to facilitate easy data extraction and analysis.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "employee_time_tracking" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all time tracking data and logs.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files (time logs, employee data, configurations) are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
