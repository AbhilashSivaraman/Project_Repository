# Server Mangement for VPN Server

---

### **1. Directory Creation & Organization:**
   - Create a directory named "vpn_configs".
   - Inside "vpn_configs", create subdirectories for different types of VPN configurations like "openvpn", "ipsec", and "pptp".
   - In each subdirectory, place configuration files such as "server.conf", "client.conf", and certificates for each protocol.

---

### **2. Move and Rename Files:**
   - Move a configuration file, for example, "old_openvpn.conf", from the "openvpn" directory to "archived_configs".
   - Rename a file in the "ipsec" directory from "ipsec_config_old" to "ipsec_config_v2" and verify the change.

---

### **3. Navigation & Listing Files:**
   - Navigate to the "vpn_configs" directory.
   - List the contents of the "openvpn" and "ipsec" directories and verify the presence of all VPN configuration files and certificates.

---

### **4. File Permissions Management:**
   - Create a file named "vpn_server_cert.pem" in the "vpn_configs" directory.
   - Change the permissions so that only the VPN server admin user can read and write to this file, while others have no access.
   - Verify the permission changes using `ls -l`.

---

### **5. Backup Files:**
   - Create a backup of the "openvpn" directory configuration files to a backup directory named "vpn_backup".
   - Verify the backup by listing the contents of the "vpn_backup" directory.

---

### **6. Removing Files & Directories:**
   - Delete an old VPN configuration file (e.g., "pptp_old_config.conf") from the "pptp" directory.
   - Remove an empty subdirectory (e.g., "unused_configs") under "vpn_configs".

---

### **7. Creating a Script for File Generation:**
   - Write a script that generates multiple VPN client configuration files with unique names, like "client_1.ovpn", "client_2.ovpn", each with different configurations and certificates.

---

### **8. Exploring File History:**
   - View the last 20 commands executed to check changes made to the VPN server configuration.
   - Search the history for commands related to file manipulations or VPN service restarts.

---

### **9. System Monitoring:**
   - Check the server uptime to ensure continuous VPN service availability.
   - Monitor the system's resource usage (CPU, memory, and network usage) to identify any potential bottlenecks affecting VPN connections.

---

### **10. Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Verify the ownership and group of sensitive VPN files (e.g., certificates and configuration files) to ensure correct access rights.
   - Check that files such as "vpn_server_cert.pem" are only accessible by root or the VPN administrator.

---

### **11. Ping Test & Network Verification:**
   - Test the connectivity of the VPN server by pinging a remote VPN client or external server.
   - Record the response times and verify that the VPN network is operational.

---

### **12. Search for Specific Files or Content:**
   - Search for specific VPN configuration files (e.g., "server.conf") within the "vpn_configs" directory.
   - Search for a particular string (e.g., "remote") inside VPN configuration files to verify the server's settings.

---

### **13. Create a Directory for Each User:**
   - Create individual directories for VPN users within the "vpn_configs" directory, such as "user1_configs", "user2_configs".
   - Assign appropriate read and write permissions for each directory based on user access requirements.

---

### **14. Create a Script for Directory Cleanup:**
   - Write a script that deletes all empty directories from the "vpn_configs" directory that are no longer required after the VPN configuration update.

---

### **15. File Sorting & Management:**
   - Sort VPN configuration files by size and list the files based on their size in the "vpn_configs" directory.
   - Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the VPN configuration directories.

---

### **16. File Type Identification:**
   - Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., `.pem`, `.ovpn`) in the "vpn_configs" directory.
   - List all certificate files in the directory to ensure proper certificate management.

---

### **17. File Compression and Archive:**
   - Compress the "vpn_backup" directory into a single archive file named "vpn_backup.tar.gz" for future use.
   - Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it using `tar -tf vpn_backup.tar.gz`.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
