# Server Management for VoIP

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "voip_system".
2. Inside "voip_system", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files to track VoIP logs, such as "call_records.txt", "system_error_logs.txt", "voice_data_backup.txt", or "call_quality_metrics.txt" for storing VoIP call data and system logs.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a VoIP call log or configuration file (e.g., "January_call_logs.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a VoIP system configuration file (e.g., "voip_config_v1.txt" to "voip_config_v2.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "voip_system" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") along with the VoIP call logs and configuration files.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "voip_security_logs.txt" in the "voip_system" directory to store sensitive VoIP security information.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized administrators have read, write, and execute access.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify or access the security logs.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a VoIP configuration file (e.g., "voip_config_v2.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the configuration file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated VoIP log file (e.g., "old_call_records.txt") in the "voip_system" directory.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it contains no relevant VoIP call data or logs).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 VoIP call log files (e.g., "call_log_1.txt", "call_log_2.txt") in the "voip_system" directory to simulate call data for system monitoring or testing purposes.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to VoIP log management, such as handling call records, configuration updates, or error logs.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or handling of VoIP data and logs.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure the VoIP server is running and actively managing voice communications.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the VoIP server can handle the required number of concurrent calls, call quality analysis, and system monitoring.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "voip_security_logs.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only VoIP administrators or authorized personnel can modify or access the file.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server or a VoIP peer to ensure that the VoIP server can establish voice call sessions over the network.
2. Record the response times and verify the network latency to ensure low-latency, high-quality voice calls.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific call log file (e.g., "call_log_1.txt") within the "voip_system" directory to identify and analyze specific VoIP calls.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "call_quality") inside one of the VoIP logs to assess the quality of voice calls over time.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each VoIP user or extension (e.g., "user_1001", "user_1002") to store their individual call records and logs.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user and authorized administrators can modify or access their call data and logs.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "voip_system" directory to maintain an organized file structure and remove any directories no longer in use.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the VoIP call records and log files in a directory by size or modification date and list the files based on their size or most recent updates.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest call log files to help identify large call data files or outdated logs that need to be archived or cleaned.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., text files, CSV files) in the "voip_system" directory to facilitate the management of structured data files such as call logs or reports.
2. Filter and list only the call log files to facilitate easy tracking of call activity and performance metrics.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "voip_system" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all VoIP logs, system configurations, and security data.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files (call logs, configuration files, security reports) are included in the backup.
