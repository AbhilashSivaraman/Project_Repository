# Server Management for Block Chain

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "blockchain_node".
2. Inside "blockchain_node", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files corresponding to blockchain node logs, transaction data, or configuration files (e.g., "node_log.txt", "blockchain_data.db", "config.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a blockchain transaction log file (e.g., "node_log.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a configuration file (e.g., "config.json" to "node_config_v2.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "blockchain_node" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant blockchain logs, transaction files, and configurations.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "blockchain_data.txt" in the "blockchain_node" directory to store important node data.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the blockchain node software and administrators can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure only authorized users or applications can access critical blockchain data.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of an important blockchain configuration file (e.g., "config.json") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the configuration file has been correctly copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated node log file (e.g., "node_log_old.txt") in the "blockchain_node" directory that is no longer required.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's no longer needed and contains no useful files).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 blockchain transaction log files (e.g., "transaction_1.log", "transaction_2.log") in the "blockchain_node" directory to simulate blockchain node transactions.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to blockchain node operations, such as node startup, transactions, or configuration changes.
2. Search the history for any command related to blockchain data management or log file modifications.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the blockchain node has been continuously running and available for processing transactions.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure that the server has sufficient resources (CPU, memory) to handle blockchain node operations and transaction processing.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "blockchain_data.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized personnel and blockchain node software can modify it.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote blockchain network node to ensure the server is properly connected and can communicate with other nodes in the blockchain network.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is minimal for fast transaction propagation and node synchronization.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific transaction file (e.g., "transaction_1.log") within the "blockchain_node" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "block processed") inside one of the transaction log files to locate the specific transaction data or blocks in the blockchain.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each node operator or blockchain participant (e.g., "node_operator_01", "node_operator_02") to store their specific node logs, configurations, and transaction data.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective operator or node software can modify or access their blockchain-related files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "blockchain_node" directory to keep the system organized and remove unused directories related to node logs or outdated transaction data.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort blockchain log files by size (e.g., large transaction logs, smaller error logs) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest transaction logs to help identify key blockchain events and optimize storage for critical logs.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., .log, .db, .json) in the "blockchain_node" directory to organize and separate transaction logs, blockchain data, and configuration files.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .log files for node activity) to streamline the review of blockchain events and activities.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "blockchain_node" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all logs, transaction data, and node configurations.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
