# Server Management for Bulk SMS

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "bulk_sms".
2. Inside "bulk_sms", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files representing SMS logs or configurations for different campaigns (e.g., "campaign_1_sms_log.txt", "campaign_2_config.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move an SMS log file (e.g., "campaign_1_sms_log.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file (e.g., "campaign_2_config.json" to "campaign_2_updated_config.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "bulk_sms" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant SMS logs or configuration files.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "sms_config.txt" in the "bulk_sms" directory to store configuration settings for SMS sending.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the system administrator can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure only authorized users can modify SMS configurations.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of an SMS log file (e.g., "campaign_1_sms_log.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated SMS log file (e.g., "campaign_1_old_log.txt") in the "bulk_sms" directory that is no longer needed.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty and no longer needed).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique SMS log files (e.g., "sms_log_1.txt", "sms_log_2.txt") in the "bulk_sms" directory to simulate the sending of bulk SMS messages for different campaigns.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to SMS log management, including file creation, editing, and backup tasks.
2. Search the history for any command related to SMS log file manipulation or backup operations.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the Bulk SMS Server has been running without interruptions and handling SMS traffic efficiently.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to confirm that the server can handle the high volume of outgoing SMS requests.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "sms_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure only the SMS management team can modify it.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging the SMS gateway to ensure the Bulk SMS Server is connected and can send messages.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is low for quick delivery of SMS messages.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific SMS log file (e.g., "campaign_1_sms_log.txt") within the "bulk_sms" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "message sent successfully") inside one of the SMS log files to locate successful message logs.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each SMS campaign manager (e.g., "campaign_manager_01", "sms_admin_02") to store their personal SMS logs and configurations.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure only the respective user can modify or access their files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "bulk_sms" directory to keep the system organized and remove unused directories related to SMS campaigns.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort SMS log files by size (e.g., large logs, campaign-specific logs) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest SMS log files to optimize storage and ensure the most relevant files are easily accessible.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., text files, JSON configuration files) in the "bulk_sms" directory to organize SMS logs and configurations.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .txt or .json configuration files) to streamline the review of SMS logs and campaign settings.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "bulk_sms" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all SMS log files and campaign configurations.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant SMS logs and configurations are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
