# Server Management for Media Management Server

---

### **1. Directory Creation & Organization:**
   - Create a directory named "media_server".
   - Inside "media_server", create subdirectories for "movies", "music", and "shows".
   - Within each subdirectory, create further directories for genres like "Action", "Drama", "Rock", "Pop", etc.

---

### **2. Move and Rename Files:**
   - Move a media file (e.g., "trailer.mp4") from the "movies" directory to a subdirectory "Drama".
   - Rename an audio file in the "music" directory from "track.mp3" to "rock_track.mp3" and verify the change.

---

### **3. Navigation & Listing Files:**
   - Navigate to the "media_server" directory.
   - List the contents to verify the presence of all subdirectories and media files.

---

### **4. File Permissions Management:**
   - Create a file named "streaming_config.txt" in the "media_server" directory to represent server configurations.
   - Set permissions so only the admin user can read, write, and execute this file.
   - Verify permissions using `ls -l`.

---

### **5. Backup Files:**
   - Copy a media file from the "movies" directory to a backup directory named "media_backup".
   - Verify the backup by listing the contents of the "media_backup" directory.

---

### **6. Removing Files & Directories:**
   - Delete an outdated media file (e.g., "old_movie.mp4") from the "movies" directory.
   - Remove an empty genre directory (e.g., "Jazz") from the "music" section.

---

### **7. Creating a Script for File Generation:**
   - Write a script that generates 20 dummy media files (e.g., "media_1.mp4", "media_2.mp4") in the "movies" directory with placeholder content.

---

### **8. Exploring File History:**
   - View the last 20 commands executed to check changes made to the media file organization.
   - Search the history for commands related to moving or renaming files.

---

### **9. System Monitoring:**
   - Check the server uptime to ensure the streaming service has been running continuously.
   - Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, and network) to ensure smooth streaming.

---

### **10. Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Verify the ownership of media files in the "shows" directory to ensure correct user access.
   - Confirm that sensitive files (e.g., "streaming_config.txt") are not accessible by unauthorized users.

---

### **11. Ping Test & Network Verification:**
   - Test network connectivity to a content delivery network (CDN) by pinging its server.
   - Verify the latency and response times for media streaming purposes.

---

### **12. Search for Specific Files or Content:**
   - Search for a specific file (e.g., "Action_movie.mp4") in the "movies" directory.
   - Search for a specific text (e.g., "HD Quality") in configuration files like "streaming_config.txt".

---

### **13. Create a Directory for Each Media Type:**
   - Create directories for each media resolution (e.g., "1080p", "4K", "SD") under the "media_server" directory.
   - Move media files to these directories based on their resolution.

---

### **14. Create a Script for Directory Cleanup:**
   - Write a script that deletes all empty genre subdirectories from the "music" and "shows" directories.

---

### **15. File Sorting & Management:**
   - Sort media files in the "movies" directory by size.
   - Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in each genre.

---

### **16. File Type Identification:**
   - Identify and list all video files in the "movies" directory.
   - Find all audio files in the "music" directory.

---

### **17. File Compression and Archive:**
   - Compress the "media_backup" directory into an archive file named "backup_media.tar.gz".
   - Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
