# Server Management for Web Caching

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "web_cache".
2. Inside "web_cache", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files for caching logs (e.g., "cache_log.txt"), cached HTML pages (e.g., "cached_page_1.html"), and configuration files (e.g., "cache_config.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a cached webpage file (e.g., "cached_page_1.html") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a configuration file (e.g., "cache_config.json" to "cache_config_v2.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "web_cache" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant cache files, logs, and configurations.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "cache_data.txt" in the "web_cache" directory to store important caching information.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the caching system or administrators can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized users or the caching system can access it.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of an important configuration file (e.g., "cache_config.json") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the configuration file has been correctly copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated cached webpage file (e.g., "cached_page_old.html") in the "web_cache" directory that is no longer required.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it contains no cached data or logs).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 cached webpage files (e.g., "cached_page_1.html", "cached_page_2.html") in the "web_cache" directory to simulate cached pages.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to the caching server operations, such as cache creation, data invalidation, or configuration changes.
2. Search the history for any command related to cache data management or log file modifications.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the web caching server has been continuously running and handling requests.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server has enough resources (CPU, memory) to process requests and manage cache effectively.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "cache_data.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized personnel or the caching server can modify the file.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server or a web resource to ensure that the web caching server can retrieve and cache content correctly.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is minimal for fast content retrieval and caching.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific cached webpage file (e.g., "cached_page_1.html") within the "web_cache" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "cache hit") inside one of the cache log files to identify successful cache hits and invalidation events.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each content provider or web application in your system (e.g., "site_1", "site_2") to store their respective cached files, logs, and configurations.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective users or caching system components can modify or access their cache data.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "web_cache" directory to keep the system organized and remove any unused cache data from inactive months.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort cached files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size (e.g., larger HTML files, smaller image cache files).
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest cached files to help optimize caching strategy and prioritize content.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list cached files of a specific type (e.g., HTML files, image files) in the "web_cache" directory to streamline the management of web content caching.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only HTML files) to optimize cache storage and content delivery.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "web_cache" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all cached data and configuration files.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files (cache logs, HTML files, configurations) are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
