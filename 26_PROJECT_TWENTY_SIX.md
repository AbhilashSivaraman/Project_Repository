# Server Management for Data Warehouse Server

---

### **1. Directory Creation & Organization:**
   - Create a directory named "data_warehouse_server".
   - Inside this directory, create subdirectories for different data categories or stages of the data pipeline, such as "Raw_Data", "Processed_Data", "Analytics", and "Backups".
   - Within each directory, organize files according to their data sources or use cases, such as "sales_data", "customer_data", or "inventory_data".

---

### **2. Move and Rename Files:**
   - As raw data is ingested into the data warehouse, move files from "Raw_Data" to "Processed_Data" once they have been cleaned or transformed.
   - Rename files in the "Processed_Data" directory to include versioning or timestamps (e.g., "customer_data_2024Q1.csv") for tracking and version control.

---

### **3. Navigation & Listing Files:**
   - Navigate to the "data_warehouse_server" directory and list its contents.
   - Verify that the subdirectories for raw data, processed data, and backups are present, and ensure that relevant files have been appropriately moved or renamed.

---

### **4. File Permissions Management:**
   - Create a sensitive file, such as "data_warehouse_summary.csv", in the "data_warehouse_server" directory, containing aggregated analytics data.
   - Change the permissions on this file to allow only authorized users to access or modify the data (e.g., analysts or admins).
   - Verify that the permissions are correctly set by listing the file details and confirming that unauthorized users cannot access it.

---

### **5. Backup Files:**
   - Create a backup of critical data, such as the latest analytics reports, by copying it to a "backup" directory.
   - Verify that the backup directory is up to date and that the backup files are intact.

---

### **6. Removing Files & Directories:**
   - Remove obsolete or irrelevant data files from the "Raw_Data" directory that are no longer needed after processing.
   - Delete empty directories from the "Processed_Data" section after data transformation is complete and no further processing is needed.

---

### **7. Creating a Script for File Generation:**
   - Write a script that generates sample data files (e.g., sales data or customer data) for testing purposes, using unique file names (e.g., "sales_data_001.csv").
   - Use the script to simulate the arrival of new data and test various stages of the data pipeline.

---

### **8. Exploring File History:**
   - View the history of commands related to file movement, renaming, and backup processes within the data warehouse server.
   - Search for any commands related to file manipulation or batch processing to ensure the data management procedures are being followed properly.

---

### **9. System Monitoring:**
   - Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the server is continuously available for data processing tasks.
   - Monitor the server’s resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) to ensure that it can handle large data operations, especially during data ingestion or transformation.

---

### **10. Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Verify the ownership and group of key data files within the data warehouse, ensuring that they belong to the correct user or group (e.g., the analytics team).
   - Ensure that sensitive data files, like customer data or financial data, have appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### **11. Ping Test & Network Verification:**
   - Perform a network ping test to verify the server’s connectivity with other systems that feed data into the warehouse or retrieve data from it, such as ETL systems or business intelligence platforms.
   - Monitor for network disruptions that could affect data transfer or analytics tasks.

---

### **12. Search for Specific Files or Content:**
   - Search for specific data files within the "Raw_Data" or "Processed_Data" directories to quickly locate records related to a specific region, customer, or time period.
   - Use search operations to look for particular data points within files, such as identifying records for a specific product or sales territory.

---

### **13. Create a Directory for Each User:**
   - Create individual directories for data analysts, ETL developers, or database administrators within the "data_warehouse_server" directory.
   - Assign appropriate permissions to each user’s directory, ensuring only authorized personnel can access, modify, or analyze the data.

---

### **14. Create a Script for Directory Cleanup:**
   - Write a script that deletes empty directories within the "Processed_Data" or "Analytics" directories after the data processing or analysis has been completed.
   - Automate the cleanup process to maintain a tidy directory structure, preventing the accumulation of unused directories.

---

### **15. File Sorting & Management:**
   - Sort data files based on size to identify large files that may require further compression or archiving.
   - Create a report listing the largest and smallest data files within the warehouse to identify areas for optimization or resource management.

---

### **16. File Type Identification:**
   - Identify and list files by their type, such as CSV, JSON, or XML, to ensure proper handling during data processing or when setting up automated data pipelines.
   - Organize files by type for better categorization and easier retrieval.

---

### **17. File Compression and Archive:**
   - Compress historical data files into a single archive to save storage space, especially for files that are infrequently accessed but must be retained for compliance purposes.
   - Verify the contents of the archive to ensure that all necessary files are included.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
