# Server Management for IOT Devices

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "iot_devices".
2. Inside "iot_devices", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each monthâ€™s directory, create files that represent IoT device logs or status reports (e.g., "device_log_day_1.txt", "device_status_day_1.csv").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file (e.g., "device_log_day_1.txt") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "device_status_day_1.csv" to "device_status_day_1_updated.csv") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "iot_devices" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all month directories (e.g., "January", "February", etc.) and the device logs or status files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "iot_device_info.txt" in the "iot_devices" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a file (e.g., "device_log_day_1.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the files in the "iot_devices" directory (e.g., delete "device_status_day_1.csv").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "iot_devices" directory, with each file representing unique IoT device logs or status reports (e.g., "device_log_1.txt", "device_status_2.csv").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to device log management or file manipulation.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the IoT device management server is consistently running and processing data.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle the large volume of IoT device data being generated.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "iot_device_info.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for handling sensitive device configuration data.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging an IoT device or an external API service used by the IoT devices.
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the IoT devices and the management server.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific file within the "iot_devices" directory by its name (e.g., search for "device_log_day_15.txt").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "battery level") inside one of the device logs in the directory.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each IoT Device:**

1. Create a directory for each IoT device (e.g., "device_1", "device_2") and assign appropriate permissions to manage the device logs, configurations, and status reports.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "iot_devices" directory to keep the file structure organized and ensure that unused directories are removed.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the device logs in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size to help in managing large IoT data files.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to identify resource-heavy device logs.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .txt, .csv) used for storing IoT device logs and status reports in the "iot_devices" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress a directory (e.g., "device_logs") into a single archive file to create a backup of IoT device logs.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all necessary IoT device data files, such as logs and status reports.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
