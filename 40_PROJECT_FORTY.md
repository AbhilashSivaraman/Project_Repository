# Server Management for Mobile App Backend

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "mobile_app_backend_data".
2. Inside "mobile_app_backend_data", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files for storing data related to user activities, API responses, or logs (e.g., "user_activity_day_1.json", "api_logs_day_1.log").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file containing user activity data (e.g., "user_activity_day_1.json") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "api_logs_day_1.log" to "api_logs_day_1_backup.log") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and the relevant files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "backend_config.txt" in the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a log file (e.g., "api_logs_day_1.log") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup_logs").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the outdated or irrelevant log files in the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory (e.g., delete "user_activity_day_1.json").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 unique log or user activity files inside the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory, each representing a day of activity or API interaction (e.g., "user_activity_1.json", "api_log_2.log").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to user activity logging or API response manipulation.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the mobile app backend server is running smoothly and has been active for a desired period.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure it can handle multiple API requests and heavy traffic.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "backend_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct, ensuring only authorized personnel have control over configuration files.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging external APIs or services the mobile app backend interacts with.
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the server and any essential services like user authentication or content delivery.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific log file (e.g., "api_logs_day_15.log") within the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "error") inside one of the log files to identify issues in API responses or user activities.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user interacting with the mobile app backend server (e.g., "user_1", "user_2") and assign appropriate permissions to store user-specific activity data, preferences, and logs.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory to maintain a tidy file structure and ensure no unnecessary directories consume server space.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort log files in the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory by size, then list the files based on their size to identify large files that may need to be archived or optimized.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to help with managing server storage and performance.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .json, .log) used for storing user activity data, API responses, or error logs in the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "mobile_app_backend_data" directory into a single archive file to create a backup of user activity data, API logs, and configuration files.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure all necessary files are included in the backup.
