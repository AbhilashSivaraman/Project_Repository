# Server Management for Cloud Gateway

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "cloud_gateway_logs".
2. Inside "cloud_gateway_logs", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files to store logs for each day (e.g., "gateway_log_day_1.txt", "gateway_log_day_2.txt").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a log file (e.g., "gateway_log_day_1.txt") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a log file within a directory (e.g., rename "gateway_log_day_1.txt" to "final_gateway_log_day_1.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and the relevant log files created.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "config.txt" in the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory to store configuration settings for the gateway (e.g., security or routing configurations).
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a log file (e.g., "gateway_log_day_1.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated log file (e.g., "gateway_log_day_1.txt") in the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory that is no longer needed.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 unique log files (e.g., "log_1.txt", "log_2.txt") in the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory, simulating logs for cloud gateway traffic or requests.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to file management in the gateway logs.
2. Search the history for any command related to log file manipulation, backups, or security updates.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the cloud gateway server has been operational without interruption.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics, focusing on network traffic and CPU usage, to ensure that the cloud gateway can handle incoming and outgoing traffic efficiently.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct, ensuring only authorized users can modify the gateway configuration.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging remote servers or cloud resources that interact with the cloud application gateway.
2. Record the response times and verify that the network latency is within acceptable limits for seamless traffic routing.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific log file (e.g., "gateway_log_day_1.txt") within the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "error" or "404") inside one of the log files to identify potential issues in the traffic routing or service availability.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user or team (e.g., "admin_logs", "developer_logs") to store their respective logs or configuration files for monitoring.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to each user/team to ensure secure access to their logs and settings.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory to keep the directory structure tidy and free from unused files.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the log files by size (e.g., large logs that contain detailed traffic analysis or errors) and then list the files based on their size to optimize storage and data management.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to identify unnecessary logs that could be archived.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., log files, configuration files) in the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory to ensure proper management of different file types related to the gateway.
2. Filter log files based on their type or format (e.g., .txt, .json) to streamline the processing and analysis of logs.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "cloud_gateway_logs" directory into a single archive file to create a backup of all logs and configurations related to the cloud application gateway.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it, ensuring that all necessary log files and configurations are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
