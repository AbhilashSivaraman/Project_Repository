# Server Management for Video Editing

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "video_projects".
2. Inside "video_projects", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month's directory, create files representing video projects or raw footage (e.g., "project_day_1.mp4", "footage_day_1.mov", "project_day_1.wav").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a video file (e.g., "footage_day_1.mp4") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "footage_day_1.mp4" to "footage_day_1_final.mp4") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "video_projects" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and the relevant video files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "render_config.txt" in the "video_projects" directory to store settings related to video rendering (e.g., resolution, frame rate).
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a video file (e.g., "footage_day_1.mp4") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup_video_files").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated video file (e.g., "footage_day_1.mp4") in the "video_projects" directory that is no longer needed.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if itâ€™s empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 unique video files (e.g., "video_project_1.mp4", "video_project_2.mp4") in the "video_projects" directory, simulating different video editing sessions.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation, video rendering, or project management.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure that the video editing server is continuously available for processing and rendering tasks.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics, especially CPU and RAM, to ensure the server is capable of handling video rendering workloads.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "render_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct, ensuring only authorized users have access to modify the rendering settings.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging remote video storage or cloud services where video files might be uploaded or stored.
2. Record the response times and verify that the server can quickly access external storage or rendering resources.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific video project file (e.g., "video_project_5.mp4") within the "video_projects" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "error") inside one of the video rendering log files to identify any rendering issues.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user or video editing team (e.g., "user_1_projects", "user_2_projects") and assign appropriate permissions to store their respective video files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "video_projects" directory, ensuring that unused or outdated directories are removed.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort video project files by size (e.g., large final render files) and then list the files based on their size, ensuring proper management of disk space.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest video files in the directory to help in archiving or compressing large files.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list video files of a specific type (e.g., .mp4, .avi, .mov) in the "video_projects" directory, to manage video formats and prepare them for rendering or distribution.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "video_projects" directory into a single archive file to create a backup of all video projects and raw footage.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it, ensuring that all necessary files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
