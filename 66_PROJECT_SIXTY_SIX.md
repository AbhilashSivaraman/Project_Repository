# Server Management for Task Scheduling

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "task_automation".
2. Inside "task_automation", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files named after different scheduled tasks or automation scripts, such as "backup_task.sh", "report_generation.py", or "cleanup_task.bat".

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move an automation script (e.g., "daily_report.py") from one month’s directory (e.g., "January") to another (e.g., "February") to keep task schedules organized by time.
2. Rename a file (e.g., "old_backup_task.sh" to "new_backup_task.sh") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "task_automation" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories and files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "sensitive_task.sh" in the "task_automation" directory to store confidential automation scripts.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized users have read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify or execute the automation scripts.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a critical automation script (e.g., "backup_task.sh") by copying it to a backup directory for redundancy.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated script (e.g., "old_cleanup_task.bat") in the "task_automation" directory to remove unnecessary automation tasks.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., "March") if no relevant automation tasks are assigned for that period.

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 task automation files (e.g., "task_1.sh", "task_2.bat") for different types of scheduled tasks in the system.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to task scheduling and file management.
2. Search the history for any command related to task automation or file manipulation within the "task_automation" directory.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure the Task Scheduling and Automation server has been running continuously to process and manage scheduled tasks.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle multiple automation jobs simultaneously.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of an automation script (e.g., "database_backup.sh") and verify whether they are correct to ensure proper access rights for task automation.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server that the automation server interacts with (e.g., for external API calls or backup servers).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity to ensure seamless task execution that requires network access.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific task automation script (e.g., "email_notification.py") within the "task_automation" directory to locate and review scheduled tasks.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "cron") inside one of the automation scripts to find and explore the cron job configuration.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user (e.g., "admin", "developer") managing scheduled tasks in the "task_automation" system to store their personal automation scripts and job logs.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user and authorized administrators can modify or access their personal automation files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "task_automation" directory to keep the file system clean after removing unused tasks or scripts.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort automation scripts in a directory by size or modification date and list the files based on the most recently updated or largest tasks.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest automation scripts, identifying large tasks that may need optimization or smaller tasks that can be grouped.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of specific types (e.g., shell scripts, Python files) in the "task_automation" directory to focus on sorting or reviewing scripts based on their extensions.
2. Filter and list only the files related to specific automation categories, such as backup tasks ("backup_*.sh") or reporting tasks ("report_*.py").

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "task_automation" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all automation scripts and task schedules.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant automation scripts and task configurations are included.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
