# Server Management for CI/CD Deployment Server

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "ci_cd_pipeline".
2. Inside "ci_cd_pipeline", create 12 subdirectories, each representing a stage of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., "source_code", "build", "test", "staging", "production").
3. Inside each stage directory, create files representing configurations or logs (e.g., "build_config.txt", "test_results.txt") related to that stage.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file (e.g., "build_config.txt") from one stage directory to another (e.g., from "build" to "test").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "test_results.txt" to "unit_test_results.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all stage directories (e.g., "source_code", "build", "test") and files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "pipeline_config.txt" in the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a file (e.g., "pipeline_config.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the files in the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory (e.g., delete "test_results.txt").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the CI/CD pipeline stages (e.g., remove the "staging" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory, with each file representing a different build log or test result (e.g., "build_log_1.txt", "test_result_2.txt").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or CI/CD activities.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the CI/CD server is running continuously.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to monitor the performance of builds, deployments, and tests.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "pipeline_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for CI/CD pipeline configurations.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server (e.g., a repository server or a cloud instance running your application).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the CI/CD pipeline components.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific file within the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory by its name (e.g., search for "build_log.txt").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "error") inside one of the files in the directory, such as a build log or test result.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each CI/CD pipeline developer or team in the system and assign appropriate permissions to manage their respective pipeline configurations.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory to clean up after completed or removed pipeline stages.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size, helping to organize build logs or test results.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in a directory to manage resource-heavy logs or outputs.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .yaml, .json, .txt) used for pipeline configurations, build logs, or deployment scripts in the "ci_cd_pipeline" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress a directory (e.g., "build_logs") into a single archive file to create a backup of pipeline-related files and logs.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all necessary build logs or configuration files.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
