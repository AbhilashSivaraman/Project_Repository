# Server Management for API Gateway Server

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "api_gateway".
2. Inside "api_gateway", create 12 subdirectories, each representing a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month's directory, create files representing logs for different API calls or configurations (e.g., "log_day_1.txt", "config_week_1.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file (e.g., "log_day_1.txt") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "config_week_1.json" to "config_week_1_updated.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "api_gateway" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all month directories (e.g., "January", "February", etc.) and the API logs or config files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "api_access_log.txt" in the "api_gateway" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a file (e.g., "api_access_log.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the files in the "api_gateway" directory (e.g., delete "log_day_1.txt").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "api_gateway" directory, with each file representing different API access logs or configurations (e.g., "log_1.txt", "config_2.json").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to API gateway log management or file manipulation.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the API gateway server is continuously running and processing API requests.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle the volume of incoming API requests and responses.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "api_access_log.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for managing API logs and configurations.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server (e.g., an external API server or microservice).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the API gateway server and external services.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific file within the "api_gateway" directory by its name (e.g., search for "log_day_15.txt").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "404 error") inside one of the logs in the directory, such as an error log related to failed API requests.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each API user or service (e.g., "user_1", "service_a") and assign appropriate permissions to manage their respective logs or configurations.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "api_gateway" directory to maintain a clean file structure for API logs and configurations.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the log files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size to manage large API request/response logs effectively.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to identify resource-heavy API logs.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .log, .json, .xml) used for storing API gateway logs or configurations in the "api_gateway" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress a directory (e.g., "logs") into a single archive file to create a backup of API logs and configurations for storage or transport.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all the necessary files, such as logs and configuration files.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
