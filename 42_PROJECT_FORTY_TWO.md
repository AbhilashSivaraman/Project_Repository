# Server Management for Session Management Server

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "session_data".
2. Inside "session_data", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files for storing session logs, user session history, or timeout data (e.g., "session_logs_day_1.json", "user_sessions_day_1.log").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file containing session data (e.g., "session_logs_day_1.json") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "session_logs_day_1.log" to "session_logs_day_1_backup.log") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "session_data" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and the relevant session files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "session_config.txt" in the "session_data" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a log file (e.g., "session_logs_day_1.log") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup_sessions").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the outdated or irrelevant session files in the "session_data" directory (e.g., delete "user_sessions_day_1.json").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 unique session files inside the "session_data" directory, each representing a day's session data (e.g., "session_data_1.json", "user_session_2.log").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to session management, user sessions, or session timeouts.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the session management server is running smoothly and has been active for the desired period.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure it can handle multiple concurrent session management requests efficiently.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "session_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct, ensuring that only authorized personnel have control over session configuration data.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging the external services the session management server interacts with (e.g., database servers for session storage or third-party session providers).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the server and external services used for session management.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific session file (e.g., "user_sessions_day_15.json") within the "session_data" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "session_timeout") inside one of the session log files to identify expired or terminated sessions.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user interacting with the session management system (e.g., "user_1", "user_2") and assign appropriate permissions to store user-specific session data, timeouts, and session logs.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "session_data" directory to maintain a tidy file structure and ensure no unnecessary directories consume server space.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort session files in the "session_data" directory by size, then list the files based on their size to identify large files that may need to be archived or optimized.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to help with managing server storage and performance.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .json, .log) used for storing session logs, user session data, or timeout events in the "session_data" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "session_data" directory into a single archive file to create a backup of session logs, user session data, and configuration files.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure all necessary files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
