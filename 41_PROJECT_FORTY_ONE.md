# Server Management for User Authentication Server

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "user_auth_data".
2. Inside "user_auth_data", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files for storing data related to user login attempts, authentication logs, or password change records (e.g., "login_attempts_day_1.json", "auth_logs_day_1.log").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file containing user authentication data (e.g., "login_attempts_day_1.json") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "auth_logs_day_1.log" to "auth_logs_day_1_backup.log") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "user_auth_data" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and the relevant files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "auth_config.txt" in the "user_auth_data" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a log file (e.g., "auth_logs_day_1.log") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup_logs").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the outdated or irrelevant log files in the "user_auth_data" directory (e.g., delete "login_attempts_day_1.json").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 unique log or user authentication files inside the "user_auth_data" directory, each representing a day of login attempts or password changes (e.g., "login_attempts_1.json", "auth_log_2.log").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to user authentication, login attempts, or password management.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the user authentication server is running smoothly and has been active for a desired period.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure it can handle multiple authentication requests.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "auth_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct, ensuring only authorized personnel have control over authentication configurations.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging the external services the user authentication server interacts with (e.g., third-party authentication providers or databases).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the server and external services used for authentication.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific log file (e.g., "auth_logs_day_15.log") within the "user_auth_data" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "failed_login") inside one of the log files to identify failed login attempts or issues in the authentication process.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user interacting with the authentication system (e.g., "user_1", "user_2") and assign appropriate permissions to store user-specific authentication logs and security data.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "user_auth_data" directory to maintain a tidy file structure and ensure no unnecessary directories consume server space.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort log files in the "user_auth_data" directory by size, then list the files based on their size to identify large files that may need to be archived or optimized.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to help with managing server storage and performance.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .json, .log) used for storing authentication logs, user session data, or failed login attempts in the "user_auth_data" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "user_auth_data" directory into a single archive file to create a backup of user authentication data, logs, and configuration files.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure all necessary files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
