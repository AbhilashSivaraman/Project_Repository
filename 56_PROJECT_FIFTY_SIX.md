# Server Management for Saas App

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "saas_application".
2. Inside "saas_application", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files representing logs, configuration files, or backup data for various SaaS modules (e.g., "module1_config.json", "error_log.txt").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move an application log file (e.g., "error_log.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a configuration file (e.g., "module1_config.json" to "module1_v2_config.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "saas_application" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant SaaS logs or configuration files.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "saas_config.txt" in the "saas_application" directory to store configuration settings for the SaaS platform.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only system administrators can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure only authorized users can modify the SaaS configurations.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of an important configuration file (e.g., "module1_v2_config.json") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated log file (e.g., "error_log_old.txt") in the "saas_application" directory that is no longer needed.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty and no longer needed).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique log files (e.g., "saas_log_1.txt", "saas_log_2.txt") in the "saas_application" directory to simulate various system events for the SaaS application.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to the SaaS application’s log management, including file creation, editing, and backup tasks.
2. Search the history for any command related to log file manipulation or backup operations.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the SaaS Application Server has been running without interruptions and can handle continuous user access.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to confirm that the server can efficiently serve the SaaS application with high availability.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "saas_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify the application configuration.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging the server hosting the SaaS application to ensure users can access it.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is low for fast access to the SaaS platform.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific log file (e.g., "saas_log_1.txt") within the "saas_application" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "error 404") inside one of the log files to locate error occurrences for troubleshooting.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each SaaS application user (e.g., "user_01", "user_02") to store their individual logs, preferences, and configurations.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user can modify or access their files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "saas_application" directory to keep the system organized and remove unused directories related to individual users or logs.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort log files by size (e.g., large error logs, user logs) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest log files to optimize storage and ensure the most relevant files are easily accessible.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., log files, configuration files) in the "saas_application" directory to organize and separate logs from configuration data.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .log or .json configuration files) to streamline review of logs and settings.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "saas_application" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all logs, configuration files, and user data.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
