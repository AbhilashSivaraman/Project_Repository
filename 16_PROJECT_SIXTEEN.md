# Server Management for Video Conference Server

---

### **1. Directory Creation & Organization:**
   - Create a directory named "video_conference_server".
   - Inside "video_conference_server", create 12 subdirectories, each representing a month of the year (e.g., "January", "February", "March", etc.).
   - Inside each month’s directory, create files corresponding to daily meeting logs (e.g., "meeting_01.log", "meeting_02.log").

---

### **2. Move and Rename Files:**
   - Move a meeting log file from one month's directory to another (e.g., move "meeting_05.log" from "May" to "June").
   - Rename a meeting log file, such as changing "meeting_old_05.log" to "meeting_05.log", and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **3. Navigation & Listing Files:**
   - Navigate to the "video_conference_server" directory and list its contents.
   - Verify that all month directories and meeting log files are present, ensuring proper organization of meeting records.

---

### **4. File Permissions Management:**
   - Create a file named "conference_config.txt" in the "video_conference_server" directory.
   - Change the permissions so that only the server administrator can read, write, and execute the file, while others can only read.
   - Verify the permission changes using `ls -l` to ensure the security of sensitive server configuration files.

---

### **5. Backup Files:**
   - Create a backup of the meeting logs and configuration files by copying them to a "backup" directory (e.g., "video_conference_server/backup").
   - Verify the backup by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure all meeting logs and critical configuration files are included.

---

### **6. Removing Files & Directories:**
   - Delete old meeting log files that are no longer needed (e.g., "meeting_01.log" from the "January" directory).
   - Remove any empty subdirectories in the server directory using `rm -r`.

---

### **7. Creating a Script for File Generation:**
   - Write a script that generates 100 meeting log files inside a directory, each with a unique name (e.g., "meeting_log_1.txt", "meeting_log_2.txt").
   - Store all meeting log files with a timestamp or unique identifier for each meeting.

---

### **8. Exploring File History:**
   - View the last 20 commands executed on the server using `history`, especially related to video conference management (e.g., server start, server stop).
   - Search for any commands related to the handling of meeting logs by using `grep` on the history (e.g., `history | grep log`).

---

### **9. System Monitoring:**
   - Check the system uptime to ensure the video conference server is running smoothly and has not been restarted unexpectedly.
   - Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) during peak video conferencing hours to ensure the server is not overloaded.

---

### **10. Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Verify the ownership and group of the meeting log files and configuration files to ensure that only authorized personnel have access.
   - Use `ls -l` to check file ownership and permissions and confirm correct settings.

---

### **11. Ping Test & Network Verification:**
   - Verify network connectivity by pinging the video conference server from a remote user’s machine.
   - Record the response times and verify network stability to ensure video quality and minimal latency during calls.

---

### **12. Search for Specific Files or Content:**
   - Use `find` or `grep` to search for specific meeting log files (e.g., "meeting_05.log" in the "May" directory).
   - Search for a specific string (e.g., "participant join") inside one of the meeting log files.

---

### **13. Create a Directory for Each User:**
   - Create a directory for each conference administrator or user on the server (e.g., "/home/admin1/.video_conference_data").
   - Assign appropriate permissions to each user directory to ensure data security.

---

### **14. Create a Script for Directory Cleanup:**
   - Write a script that deletes all empty directories within the video conference server directories, such as "empty_logs" or "unused_configurations".
   - Ensure the script is run periodically to keep the server environment clean and organized.

---

### **15. File Sorting & Management:**
   - Sort the meeting log files by size and list the largest files to identify logs that may be excessively large or need archiving.
   - Create a report listing the largest and smallest log files generated during meetings.

---

### **16. File Type Identification:**
   - Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., `.log`, `.txt`) within the video conference server directories.
   - Identify video or audio files generated by the conference system (e.g., `.mp4`, `.wav`).

---

### **17. File Compression and Archive:**
   - Compress the entire "video_conference_server" directory into a single archive file (e.g., `tar -cvf video_conference_server_backup.tar.gz`).
   - Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it by running `tar -tf video_conference_server_backup.tar.gz`.
