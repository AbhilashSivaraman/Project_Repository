# Server Management for Collaborative Work Platform

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "collaborative_workspace".
2. Inside "collaborative_workspace", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files that represent documents or tasks for each day (e.g., "meeting_notes_day_1.txt", "project_plan_day_2.txt").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a document (e.g., "project_plan_day_1.txt") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a document within a directory (e.g., rename "meeting_notes_day_1.txt" to "final_meeting_notes_day_1.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "collaborative_workspace" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and the relevant document or task files created.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "configurations.txt" in the "collaborative_workspace" directory to store platform settings or preferences (e.g., notification settings, user roles).
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a document (e.g., "project_plan_day_1.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated document (e.g., "meeting_notes_day_1.txt") in the "collaborative_workspace" directory that is no longer needed.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 unique documents (e.g., "task_1.txt", "task_2.txt") in the "collaborative_workspace" directory, simulating task notes or project deliverables.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to file management within the collaborative workspace.
2. Search the history for any command related to document manipulation, backups, or file permission changes.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the collaborative work platform server has been operational without interruption.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics, focusing on network traffic, storage usage, and CPU to ensure the platform is responsive for collaborative activities.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "configurations.txt" file and verify whether they are correct, ensuring only authorized users can modify the platform's settings.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging remote servers or team collaboration tools integrated with the platform.
2. Record the response times and verify that the network latency is low for real-time collaboration.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific document (e.g., "project_plan_day_1.txt") within the "collaborative_workspace" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "meeting notes") inside one of the documents to locate specific content or ideas discussed in team meetings.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each team or user (e.g., "developer_logs", "design_team_logs") to store their respective work files or collaboration logs.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to each user/team to ensure secure access to their documents and project files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "collaborative_workspace" directory to keep the directory structure tidy and free from unused folders.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the documents by file size (e.g., large files representing project reports or presentations) and then list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to identify documents that could be archived or require optimization.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., text files, presentation files, or spreadsheets) in the "collaborative_workspace" directory to ensure proper management of different file types related to team collaboration.
2. Filter files based on their type or format (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .ppt) to streamline the review or sharing of documents.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "collaborative_workspace" directory into a single archive file to create a backup of all collaborative work and documents.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it, ensuring that all necessary documents are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
