# Server Management for Chat Server

---

### **1. Directory Creation & Organization:**
   - Create a directory named "chat_server".
   - Inside "chat_server", create 12 subdirectories, each representing a month (e.g., "January", "February", "March", etc.).
   - Inside each month’s directory, create files corresponding to daily chat logs (e.g., "chat_log_01.txt", "chat_log_02.txt").

---

### **2. Move and Rename Files:**
   - Move a chat log file from one month's directory to another (e.g., move "chat_log_05.txt" from "May" to "June").
   - Rename a chat log file, such as changing "chat_log_old_05.txt" to "chat_log_05.txt", and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **3. Navigation & Listing Files:**
   - Navigate to the "chat_server" directory and list its contents.
   - Verify that all month directories and chat log files are present, ensuring the proper organization of chat logs.

---

### **4. File Permissions Management:**
   - Create a file named "config.json" in the "chat_server" directory containing server configurations.
   - Change the permissions so that only the server administrator has read, write, and execute permissions, while others can only read.
   - Verify the permission changes using `ls -l` to ensure the security of sensitive configuration files.

---

### **5. Backup Files:**
   - Create a backup of the chat logs and configuration files by copying them to a "backup" directory (e.g., "chat_server/backup").
   - Verify the backup by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure all important chat logs and configuration files are included.

---

### **6. Removing Files & Directories:**
   - Delete old chat log files that are no longer needed (e.g., "chat_log_01.txt" from the "January" directory).
   - Remove any empty subdirectories in the server directory using `rm -r` to keep the server environment organized.

---

### **7. Creating a Script for File Generation:**
   - Write a script that generates 100 chat log files inside a directory, each with a unique name (e.g., "chat_log_1.txt", "chat_log_2.txt").
   - Store all chat log files with a timestamp or unique identifier for each chat session.

---

### **8. Exploring File History:**
   - View the last 20 commands executed on the server using `history`, especially commands related to chat server management (e.g., starting and stopping the server).
   - Search for any commands related to the handling of chat logs by using `grep` on the history (e.g., `history | grep log`).

---

### **9. System Monitoring:**
   - Check the system uptime to ensure the chat server is running smoothly and hasn’t been restarted unexpectedly.
   - Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) during peak chat hours to ensure the server can handle multiple concurrent users.

---

### **10. Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Verify the ownership and group of chat log files and configuration files to ensure that only authorized users have access.
   - Use `ls -l` to check file ownership and permissions, confirming correct settings for sensitive files.

---

### **11. Ping Test & Network Verification:**
   - Verify network connectivity by pinging the real-time chat server from a remote user’s machine.
   - Record the response times and verify the network stability to ensure minimal latency and smooth messaging for users.

---

### **12. Search for Specific Files or Content:**
   - Use `find` or `grep` to search for specific chat log files (e.g., "chat_log_05.txt" in the "May" directory).
   - Search for a specific string (e.g., "user_joined") inside one of the chat log files to verify user activity.

---

### **13. Create a Directory for Each User:**
   - Create a directory for each user in the system (e.g., "/home/user1/chat_data").
   - Assign appropriate permissions to each user directory to ensure privacy and security for each user’s data.

---

### **14. Create a Script for Directory Cleanup:**
   - Write a script that deletes all empty directories within the chat server directories, such as "unused_logs" or "temporary_data".
   - Ensure the script is run periodically to maintain a clean environment.

---

### **15. File Sorting & Management:**
   - Sort the chat log files by size and list the largest files to identify logs that may need archiving or deletion.
   - Create a report listing the largest and smallest chat log files generated during server operation.

---

### **16. File Type Identification:**
   - Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., `.log`, `.txt`) within the chat server directories.
   - Identify any binary or multimedia files generated by users (e.g., images, videos shared in the chat).

---

### **17. File Compression and Archive:**
   - Compress the entire "chat_server" directory into a single archive file (e.g., `tar -cvf chat_server_backup.tar.gz`).
   - Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it by running `tar -tf chat_server_backup.tar.gz`.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
