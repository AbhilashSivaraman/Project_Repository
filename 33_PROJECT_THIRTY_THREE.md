# Server Management for Website Analytics Server

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "website_analytics".
2. Inside "website_analytics", create 12 subdirectories, each representing a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month's directory, create files representing daily or weekly website analytics logs (e.g., "log_day_1.txt", "log_week_1.txt").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file (e.g., "log_day_1.txt") from one monthâ€™s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "log_week_1.txt" to "log_week_1_analytics.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "website_analytics" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all month directories (e.g., "January", "February", etc.) and the analytics log files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "access_log.txt" in the "website_analytics" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a file (e.g., "access_log.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the files in the "website_analytics" directory (e.g., delete "log_week_1.txt").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "website_analytics" directory, with each file representing a different log (e.g., "log_1.txt", "log_2.txt").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or website analytics data handling.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the website analytics server is continuously tracking and logging traffic data.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle the continuous flow of analytics data.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "access_log.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for managing website analytics logs.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server (e.g., a web server hosting the site being analyzed).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the website analytics server and the web server.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific file within the "website_analytics" directory by its name (e.g., search for "log_day_15.txt").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "404 error") inside one of the logs in the directory, such as an error log.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each analytics user or team (e.g., marketing, development) and assign appropriate permissions to manage their respective logs.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "website_analytics" directory, ensuring that only directories with relevant data are retained.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the log files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size to manage large analytics logs effectively.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to identify resource-heavy logs or files with excessive data.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .log, .txt, .json) used for storing website analytics data or logs in the "website_analytics" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress a directory (e.g., "logs") into a single archive file to create a backup of website analytics logs for storage or transport.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all the necessary log files.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
