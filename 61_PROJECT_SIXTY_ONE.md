# Server Management for Product Recommendation Engine

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "product_recommendations".
2. Inside "product_recommendations", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files to track user interactions, such as "user_interaction_log.txt", "product_ratings.txt", or "recommendation_results.txt" for storing recommendation data and logs.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a product recommendation result file (e.g., "user1_recommendations.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a product recommendation file (e.g., "user_recommendations_old.txt" to "user_recommendations_updated.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "product_recommendations" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") along with recommendation logs and interaction data files.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "recommendation_data.txt" in the "product_recommendations" directory to store sensitive product recommendation data.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized personnel can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the recommendation data.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a product recommendation file (e.g., "user1_recommendations.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the recommendation data file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated or unnecessary recommendation file (e.g., "user3_recommendations_old.txt") in the "product_recommendations" directory.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it contains no recommendation data).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 recommendation result files (e.g., "user_1_recommendations.txt", "user_2_recommendations.txt") in the "product_recommendations" directory to simulate product recommendation outputs.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to product recommendation operations, such as data updates or recommendation file management.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or the handling of recommendation files.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the recommendation engine server is continuously running and processing user data.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server has enough resources (CPU, memory) to handle a large number of recommendation queries and data processing.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "recommendation_data.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized users or the product recommendation team can modify or access the file.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server to ensure that the recommendation engine server can access external databases or services to fetch product details.
2. Record the response times and verify the network latency to ensure quick response times for product recommendations.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific user’s recommendation file (e.g., "user_1_recommendations.txt") within the "product_recommendations" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "product_id") inside one of the recommendation result files to identify specific product recommendations for a user.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user in your system (e.g., "user_1", "user_2") to store their individual recommendation data and logs.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user and authorized personnel can modify or access their product recommendations.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "product_recommendations" directory to keep the system organized and remove any unnecessary directories from inactive users or months.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the recommendation files in a directory by size or date and list the files based on their size or modification date.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest recommendation files to help identify and manage any data-related issues.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., text files, JSON files) in the "product_recommendations" directory to streamline the management and processing of recommendation data.
2. Filter and list recommendation files based on their format (e.g., only JSON or CSV files) to facilitate easier data extraction and analysis.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "product_recommendations" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all recommendation data and logs.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files (recommendation logs, user data, configurations) are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
