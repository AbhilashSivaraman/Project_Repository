# Server Management for Cloud Infrastructure

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "cloud_infrastructure".
2. Inside "cloud_infrastructure", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files representing various cloud services or configurations used during that month (e.g., "AWS_instance_config.txt", "GCP_network_plan.pdf").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a configuration file (e.g., "AWS_instance_config.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file (e.g., "GCP_network_plan.txt" to "updated_GCP_network_plan.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "cloud_infrastructure" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant cloud service files created.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "cloud_architecture.txt" in the "cloud_infrastructure" directory to store architecture plans.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the cloud admin has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized users can modify the cloud architecture plan.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a configuration file (e.g., "AWS_instance_config.txt") by copying it to a backup directory for safekeeping.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated configuration file (e.g., "AWS_instance_config_old.txt") in the "cloud_infrastructure" directory that is no longer required.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty and no longer needed).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique configuration files (e.g., "network_config_1.txt", "instance_config_2.txt") in the "cloud_infrastructure" directory to simulate the creation of various cloud services and infrastructure configurations.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to cloud configuration management, including creation, editing, and backup tasks.
2. Search the history for any command related to cloud service file manipulation or backup operations.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the cloud infrastructure server has been running smoothly without interruptions, especially for handling cloud instances and services.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to confirm that the server can handle the high demand from cloud-based operations.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "cloud_architecture.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure only the cloud infrastructure team can modify it.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging remote servers or cloud services (e.g., AWS, GCP).
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is low, ensuring smooth connectivity for cloud resources and services.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific cloud configuration file (e.g., "AWS_instance_config.txt") within the "cloud_infrastructure" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "VPC settings") inside one of the files in the directory to locate configuration details for cloud services.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each cloud infrastructure engineer or admin (e.g., "cloud_admin_01", "infra_tech_02") to store their personal configuration files, logs, or cloud service documentation.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure only the respective user can modify or access their files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "cloud_infrastructure" directory to maintain organization and remove unused cloud configurations or resources.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort cloud service files by size (e.g., large cloud architecture documents, logs, configuration files) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files to optimize storage and possibly archive older configurations or logs.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., text files, configuration files, logs) in the "cloud_infrastructure" directory to organize cloud resources based on file format.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .yaml, .json configuration files) to streamline the review of cloud service setups.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "cloud_infrastructure" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all cloud service configurations.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant cloud configurations and files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
