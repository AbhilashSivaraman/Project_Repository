# Server Management for Customer Data Platform

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "cdp_data".
2. Inside "cdp_data", create 12 subdirectories, each representing a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month's directory, create files for storing customer data or logs (e.g., "customer_data_day_1.csv", "customer_activity_day_1.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file (e.g., "customer_data_day_1.csv") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "customer_activity_day_1.json" to "customer_activity_day_1_updated.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "cdp_data" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all month directories (e.g., "January", "February", etc.) and customer data or activity files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "customer_insights.txt" in the "cdp_data" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a file (e.g., "customer_data_day_1.csv") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the files in the "cdp_data" directory (e.g., delete "customer_activity_day_1.json").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "cdp_data" directory, with each file representing different customer data or activity logs (e.g., "customer_data_1.csv", "customer_activity_2.json").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to customer data management or file manipulation.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the CDP server is continuously running and processing customer data.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle the volume of customer data being processed.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "customer_insights.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for managing sensitive customer data.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server (e.g., an external data provider or API service).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the CDP server and external data sources.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific file within the "cdp_data" directory by its name (e.g., search for "customer_data_day_15.csv").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "purchase") inside one of the customer activity logs in the directory.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user or customer segment (e.g., "user_1", "segment_a") and assign appropriate permissions to manage their respective data or activity logs.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "cdp_data" directory to maintain a clean file structure for customer data and activity logs.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the customer data files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size to manage large datasets.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in the directory to identify resource-heavy customer data.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .csv, .json) used for storing customer data and activity logs in the "cdp_data" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress a directory (e.g., "customer_logs") into a single archive file to create a backup of customer data and insights.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all necessary customer data files, such as activity logs and reports.
