# Server Management for E-learning Platform

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "e_learning_platform".
2. Inside "e_learning_platform", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files representing different courses or lessons for that month (e.g., "course_material_day_1.txt", "lesson_plan_day_2.pdf").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a course file (e.g., "course_material_day_1.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file (e.g., "lesson_plan_day_1.txt" to "updated_lesson_plan_day_1.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "e_learning_platform" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant course material files created.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "course_syllabus.txt" in the "e_learning_platform" directory to store the details of a course.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the admin has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized users can modify the syllabus.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a course file (e.g., "course_material_day_1.txt") by copying it to a backup directory for safekeeping.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated lesson plan (e.g., "lesson_plan_day_1.txt") in the "e_learning_platform" directory that is no longer required.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty and no longer needed).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique course files (e.g., "module_1.txt", "module_2.pdf") in the "e_learning_platform" directory to simulate the creation of educational materials or lessons for the students.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to course file management, including creation, editing, and backup tasks.
2. Search the history for any command related to document manipulation, backups, or course file organization.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the e-learning platform has been running smoothly without interruptions, especially for live courses or sessions.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to confirm that the server can handle the traffic from students accessing course materials or participating in live sessions.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "course_syllabus.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure only the course instructor or admin can edit it.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging remote servers or cloud storage services used for storing course materials.
2. Record the response times and verify that the network latency is low for smooth access to course content by students.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific course file (e.g., "course_material_day_1.txt") within the "e_learning_platform" directory.
2. Search for specific content (e.g., "quiz questions") inside one of the lesson files to locate educational content for a specific lesson or module.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each student or instructor (e.g., "student_001", "instructor_01") to store their personal materials, assignments, or course-related content.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure only the respective student or instructor can modify or access their files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "e_learning_platform" directory to remove unused folders, ensuring the system stays clean and organized.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort course files by size (e.g., large video lectures or course PDFs) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files to optimize storage and possibly archive older content or large files.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations) in the "e_learning_platform" directory to organize the educational materials based on file format.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .pdf, .docx files) to streamline the review or sharing of materials between instructors and students.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "e_learning_platform" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all educational materials.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant course materials are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
