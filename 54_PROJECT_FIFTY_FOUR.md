# Server Management for API Rate Limiter

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "api_rate_limiting".
2. Inside "api_rate_limiting", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files representing API rate limiting configurations for different APIs or services (e.g., "service_1_limit_config.txt", "service_2_rate_limits.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a rate-limiting configuration file (e.g., "service_1_limit_config.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file (e.g., "service_2_rate_limits.json" to "service_2_updated_limits.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "api_rate_limiting" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant API rate limiting configuration files.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "api_limits.txt" in the "api_rate_limiting" directory to store rate limit configurations.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the API administrator has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized users can modify the rate-limiting configurations.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a rate-limiting configuration file (e.g., "service_1_limit_config.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated rate-limiting configuration file (e.g., "service_1_old_limits.txt") in the "api_rate_limiting" directory that is no longer required.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it’s empty and no longer needed).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique rate-limiting configuration files (e.g., "api_limit_1.txt", "api_limit_2.json") in the "api_rate_limiting" directory to simulate the creation of rate limits for various APIs.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to API rate limiting management, including file creation, editing, and backup tasks.
2. Search the history for any command related to rate-limiting configuration file manipulation or backup operations.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the rate-limiting server has been running without interruptions, handling incoming API requests effectively.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to confirm that the server can handle the high demand from managing API requests and rate limits.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "api_limits.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure only the API rate limiting team can modify it.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging remote API servers or gateways to ensure rate limiting is functioning correctly across different services.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is low for efficient API traffic management.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific API rate-limiting configuration file (e.g., "service_1_limit_config.txt") within the "api_rate_limiting" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "limit exceeded") inside one of the files to locate rate-limiting rules or log entries related to exceeded limits.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each API administrator or engineer (e.g., "api_admin_01", "rate_limit_tech_02") to store their personal rate-limiting configuration files and logs.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure only the respective user can modify or access their files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "api_rate_limiting" directory to keep the system organized and remove unused rate-limiting configurations.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort rate-limiting configuration files by size (e.g., large configuration files, logs) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest rate-limiting configuration files to optimize storage and ensure the most relevant files are easily accessible.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., text files, JSON configuration files) in the "api_rate_limiting" directory to organize rate-limiting rules and logs.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .json or .txt configuration files) to streamline the review of rate-limiting configurations.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "api_rate_limiting" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all rate-limiting configuration files.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant rate-limiting files are included in the backup.
