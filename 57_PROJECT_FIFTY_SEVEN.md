# Server Management for AI Model

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "ai_model_training".
2. Inside "ai_model_training", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files representing various AI model training logs, datasets, and configuration files (e.g., "training_log.txt", "dataset_v1.csv", "model_config.json").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a training log file (e.g., "training_log.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a configuration file (e.g., "model_config.json" to "model_v2_config.json") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "ai_model_training" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") and relevant AI logs, datasets, or model configurations.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "training_data.txt" in the "ai_model_training" directory to store dataset information for model training.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only data scientists and system administrators can read, write, and execute it.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure only authorized users can modify the training data.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of an important training dataset file (e.g., "dataset_v1.csv") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated log file (e.g., "training_log_old.txt") in the "ai_model_training" directory that is no longer needed.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty and no longer needed).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique dataset files (e.g., "dataset_1.csv", "dataset_2.csv") in the "ai_model_training" directory to simulate various input data for training AI models.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to AI model training, including dataset preparation, model configuration, and log management.
2. Search the history for any command related to training file manipulation or backup operations.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure that the AI model training server has been running without interruptions and can handle continuous AI training tasks.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to confirm that the server can efficiently train AI models with sufficient processing power and memory.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "training_data.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify the training dataset.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging the server hosting the AI model training environment to ensure the system can connect to external sources for data and model training purposes.
2. Record the response times and verify that network latency is minimal for fast access to datasets and model training resources.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific dataset file (e.g., "dataset_1.csv") within the "ai_model_training" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "epoch 10") inside one of the training log files to locate training milestones and checkpoints.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each AI team member (e.g., "data_scientist_01", "data_scientist_02") to store their individual model training logs, configurations, and datasets.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user can modify or access their training-related files.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "ai_model_training" directory to keep the system organized and remove unused directories related to training logs or outdated datasets.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort training log files by size (e.g., large training logs, smaller error logs) and list the files based on their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest training logs to optimize storage and ensure the most relevant files are easily accessible.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list specific types of files (e.g., .csv datasets, .json configuration files) in the "ai_model_training" directory to organize and separate training datasets from model configurations.
2. Filter and list files based on their type (e.g., only .log or .csv files) to streamline the review of training progress and data files.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "ai_model_training" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all logs, datasets, and model configurations.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
