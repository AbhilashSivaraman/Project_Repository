# Server Management for Cloud Management

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "cloud_management".
2. Inside "cloud_management", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a cloud service (e.g., "AWS", "Azure", "GCP", "DigitalOcean", etc.).
3. Inside each cloud service directory, create files representing tasks or services (e.g., "instance_creation.txt", "backup_policy.txt") related to that cloud provider.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a file (e.g., "instance_creation.txt") from one cloud service directory to another.
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "backup_policy.txt" to "backup_config.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "cloud_management" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories (representing cloud services) and files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "cloud_config.txt" in the "cloud_management" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a file (e.g., "cloud_config.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the files in the "cloud_management" directory (e.g., delete "instance_creation.txt").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the cloud service directories (e.g., remove the "DigitalOcean" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "cloud_management" directory, with each file representing a different cloud management task (e.g., "task_1.txt", "task_2.txt", etc.).

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or cloud management activities.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to ensure that the Cloud Management Server is performing optimally for cloud operations.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "cloud_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for cloud management purposes.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server (e.g., a cloud service provider's endpoint or a cloud resource).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity to ensure the server can interact with cloud resources.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific file within the "cloud_management" directory by its name (e.g., search for "backup_policy.txt").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "AWS instance") inside one of the files in the directory.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each cloud service user in the system and assign appropriate permissions for managing their respective cloud resources.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "cloud_management" directory, ensuring that the cloud service directories are up-to-date.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size, helping to organize cloud resource configuration files or logs by their size.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest files related to cloud management (e.g., configuration files vs log files).

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .txt, .json, .yaml) that are commonly used for cloud resource configurations, scripts, or logs in the "cloud_management" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress a directory (e.g., the "AWS" directory) into a single archive file to create a backup of cloud configuration and resource files.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that it contains all the necessary cloud configuration files.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
