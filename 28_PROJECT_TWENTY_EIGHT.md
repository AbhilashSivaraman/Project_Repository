# Server Management for ERP

---

### **1. Directory Creation & Organization:**
   - Create a directory named "erp_server".
   - Inside this directory, create subdirectories for different ERP modules like "Finance", "Inventory", "Human_Resources", "Sales", and "Purchasing".
   - Inside each module's directory, create files or logs related to daily activities, transactions, or system updates, such as "sales_report_2024-12-16", "inventory_adjustment_2024-12", etc.

---

### **2. Move and Rename Files:**
   - Move old reports or transaction logs from the "Sales" or "Finance" directories to an archive directory once they are no longer needed for daily operations.
   - Rename ERP-related files to follow a consistent naming convention, such as "finance_report_2024_Q1", ensuring easy access and management.

---

### **3. Navigation & Listing Files:**
   - Navigate to the "erp_server" directory and list its contents.
   - Verify that all ERP module directories are correctly structured and ensure that key operational files (reports, configurations, or logs) are in place.

---

### **4. File Permissions Management:**
   - Create a file, such as "financial_report.txt", in the "Finance" directory, which contains sensitive financial data.
   - Change the permissions of this file so that only authorized users (e.g., finance team) can access, modify, or execute it.
   - Verify the permissions to ensure that sensitive files are properly secured from unauthorized access.

---

### **5. Backup Files:**
   - Backup important ERP files, such as financial reports, transaction logs, or database dumps, by copying them to a backup directory.
   - Verify the backup by listing the contents of the backup directory and ensuring that all critical files are duplicated and available for disaster recovery.

---

### **6. Removing Files & Directories:**
   - Delete outdated or processed transaction logs from the "Inventory" or "Sales" directories that are no longer required.
   - Remove any empty or unused subdirectories within the ERP server structure to maintain an organized file system.

---

### **7. Creating a Script for File Generation:**
   - Write a script that generates test files for different modules of the ERP system, such as "employee_data.csv", "inventory_transactions.txt", or "purchase_orders_2024".
   - Use this script to simulate daily transactions or operations within the ERP system for testing purposes.

---

### **8. Exploring File History:**
   - Review the command history to see any file manipulations or changes made to ERP-related files, such as financial reports or inventory logs.
   - Search the history for commands related to the backup, move, or permission changes that affect ERP files.

---

### **9. System Monitoring:**
   - Check the systemâ€™s uptime to ensure that the ERP server is running continuously without disruptions.
   - Monitor system resources (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space) to ensure the server can handle the load of ERP transactions and operations without slowdowns.

---

### **10. Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Check the ownership and group of ERP-related files, especially sensitive ones like financial reports, HR employee records, and transaction logs.
   - Verify that these files are correctly assigned to the relevant departments (finance, HR, etc.) and that no unauthorized users have access.

---

### **11. Ping Test & Network Verification:**
   - Perform a ping test to ensure that the ERP server can communicate effectively with other systems, such as database servers or remote client systems.
   - Verify network connectivity to external systems that may integrate with the ERP system, such as payment gateways or third-party APIs.

---

### **12. Search for Specific Files or Content:**
   - Search for a specific file, such as an inventory report or employee payroll data, within the ERP server directory structure.
   - Search the contents of ERP data files to locate specific transactions, customer orders, or purchase entries for troubleshooting or analysis.

---

### **13. Create a Directory for Each User:**
   - Create directories for different users (e.g., HR Manager, Sales Representative, Inventory Manager) within the ERP server system, assigning permissions based on their roles.
   - Ensure that users only have access to the modules and files relevant to their tasks (e.g., HR personnel access only HR files).

---

### **14. Create a Script for Directory Cleanup:**
   - Write a script that automatically deletes empty or obsolete subdirectories within the ERP system, such as old reports or log directories that are no longer in use.
   - Schedule the script to run periodically to keep the file system clean and organized.

---

### **15. File Sorting & Management:**
   - Sort ERP files by size or creation date to identify the largest transaction logs, reports, or database dumps.
   - Create a report that lists the largest and smallest files in each ERP module directory to help with resource management and optimize file storage.

---

### **16. File Type Identification:**
   - Identify and list files by type (e.g., CSV for transaction data, TXT for reports, or XLSX for inventory records) within the ERP system to easily categorize and manage the files.
   - Use this identification process to ensure that the file formats are correct for processing or export.

---

### **17. File Compression and Archive:**
   - Compress older ERP logs or reports into archive files to save disk space, particularly large transaction logs or payroll records from previous months or years.
   - Verify the contents of the archive to ensure that important data is stored correctly for future reference or compliance requirements.
