# Server Management for Business Intelligence

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "bi_reporting_system".
2. Inside "bi_reporting_system", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files like "sales_data.csv", "customer_insights.xlsx", "profit_and_loss_report.pdf", or "quarterly_reports.xlsx" to store business intelligence data and reports.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a business intelligence report file (e.g., "Q1_sales_report.xlsx") from one month's directory (e.g., "January") to another (e.g., "February").
2. Rename a report file (e.g., "sales_data_v1.csv" to "sales_data_final.csv") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "bi_reporting_system" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories and the business intelligence data files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "confidential_report.xlsx" in the "bi_reporting_system" directory to store sensitive business intelligence data.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized users (e.g., managers or analysts) have read, write, and execute access.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify or access the sensitive data.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a critical report file (e.g., "sales_report_final.xlsx") by copying it to a backup directory for redundancy.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the report file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated report file (e.g., "Q2_sales_report_draft.xlsx") in the "bi_reporting_system" directory to keep the system organized.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it contains no relevant reports).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 business intelligence report files (e.g., "sales_report_1.xlsx", "customer_analysis_2.xlsx") to simulate data reporting for different departments or clients.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to business intelligence file handling, such as creating, editing, or moving reports.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or management of BI data and reports.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure the BI reporting server is actively processing and managing report generation.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle large BI datasets and generate reports efficiently.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "confidential_report.xlsx" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive reports.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server or a database from which the BI server fetches data to ensure that the server can access the data sources.
2. Record the response times and verify the network connectivity to ensure the BI server can retrieve data quickly for report generation.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific business intelligence report (e.g., "sales_report_final.xlsx") within the "bi_reporting_system" directory to find and analyze the latest data.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "quarterly_analysis") inside one of the report files to find detailed insights on quarterly performance.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each report user (e.g., "analyst_01", "manager_03") to store their personal reports and analysis results.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user and authorized administrators can modify or access their specific reports.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "bi_reporting_system" directory to maintain an organized and efficient file system.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the business intelligence report files in a directory by size or modification date and list the files based on the size or most recent updates.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest report files to identify large datasets or reports that might need to be archived or cleaned.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., Excel files, CSV files) in the "bi_reporting_system" directory to focus on structured reporting data like sales, customer insights, and profit/loss statements.
2. Filter and list only the report files related to a specific department or client, e.g., "sales_reports" or "financial_reports".

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "bi_reporting_system" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all business intelligence reports and related data.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant reports (e.g., sales, quarterly, financial) are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
