# Server Management for Automated Testing

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "automated_tests".
2. Inside "automated_tests", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month's directory, create files for different automated test scripts, such as "unit_tests.py", "integration_tests.sh", "performance_tests.sql", etc.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a test script (e.g., "performance_test.sh") from one month’s directory (e.g., "January") to another (e.g., "February") to organize tests based on their execution or scheduling.
2. Rename a test file (e.g., "old_unit_test.py" to "new_unit_test.py") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "automated_tests" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories and test scripts created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "test_config.json" in the "automated_tests" directory to store configuration details for automated test executions.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized users have read, write, and execute permissions, ensuring only the testing team can modify configurations.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file’s details to ensure proper access control.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a critical test script (e.g., "regression_test.py") by copying it to a backup directory to ensure test scripts are secure.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure the file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated or redundant test script (e.g., "old_integration_test.sh") in the "automated_tests" directory to keep the testing environment clean.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., "March") if no tests were conducted during that period.

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique test scripts (e.g., "test_case_1.py", "test_case_2.sh") for various types of tests like unit tests, functional tests, and regression tests.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to automated testing and file management.
2. Search the history for any command related to test execution, log file generation, or test script modification.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure the Automated Testing Server has been running continuously and is available for test executions.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to monitor if there is enough capacity to handle concurrent test executions, especially during load and performance testing.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of an automated test script (e.g., "api_test.py") and verify whether they are correct to ensure proper access control for team members involved in testing.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a test environment server (e.g., the staging or testing server) that the automated tests interact with.
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity to ensure smooth execution of integration or performance tests that rely on external services.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific test script (e.g., "login_test.py") within the "automated_tests" directory to locate and execute specific tests.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "assertEqual") inside one of the test scripts to identify assertion logic and verify test behavior.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user or team (e.g., "dev_team", "qa_team") working on the automated tests, where each can store their individual test cases or configurations.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure only authorized users can modify or execute specific test scripts.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "automated_tests" directory after tests have been completed to maintain a tidy workspace and avoid clutter.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort test scripts in a directory by size or modification date, and list the files based on the most recently updated or the largest ones.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest test scripts, helping to identify resource-heavy tests that may need optimization.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of specific types (e.g., Python scripts, Shell scripts, and configuration files) in the "automated_tests" directory to help organize the different types of tests.
2. Filter and list only files related to a specific type of test (e.g., "unit_test_*.py", "performance_test_*.sh") to focus on particular testing processes.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "automated_tests" directory into a single archive file for storage or backup purposes to keep a secure copy of all testing scripts.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant test scripts and configurations are included.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
