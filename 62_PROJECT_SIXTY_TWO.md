# Server Management for Social Media Server

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "social_media_management".
2. Inside "social_media_management", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each month’s directory, create files to track social media campaigns, such as "post_schedule.txt", "engagement_metrics.txt", "content_plan.txt", or "ad_campaign_results.txt" for storing content plans and campaign data.

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a social media post or campaign file (e.g., "January_ad_campaign.txt") from one month’s directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a social media campaign file (e.g., "social_media_strategy_old.txt" to "social_media_strategy_new.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "social_media_management" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories for each month (e.g., "January", "February") along with campaign files and engagement logs.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "content_calendar.txt" in the "social_media_management" directory to store sensitive social media scheduling information.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only authorized users have read, write, and execute access.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details to ensure that only authorized team members can modify the social media scheduling data.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a social media post file (e.g., "user_post_schedule.txt") by copying it to a backup directory.
2. Verify the backup operation by listing the contents of the backup directory to ensure that the post schedule file has been successfully copied.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete an outdated or unnecessary campaign file (e.g., "old_ad_campaign.txt") in the "social_media_management" directory.
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it contains no relevant campaign data or files).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that generates 100 content planning files (e.g., "content_plan_1.txt", "content_plan_2.txt") in the "social_media_management" directory, simulating social media content scheduling.

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed related to social media campaign file management, such as content plan updates or post scheduling operations.
2. Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or handling of social media campaign files.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system’s uptime to ensure the social media management server is running and actively handling tasks like campaign scheduling and content posting.
2. View the system’s load and resource usage statistics to ensure the server can handle multiple social media campaigns, post scheduling, and data analysis tasks.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "content_calendar.txt" file and verify whether they are correct to ensure that only the social media management team or authorized personnel can modify or access the file.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server to ensure that the social media management server can post content to external platforms (like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) or retrieve analytics data from APIs.
2. Record the response times and verify the network latency to ensure quick interaction with social media platforms.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific campaign or post file (e.g., "Instagram_campaign_1.txt") within the "social_media_management" directory.
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "post_date") inside one of the content plan files to identify and manage scheduled posts for a particular date.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each social media account or user in your system (e.g., "Instagram_account_1", "Twitter_account_1") to store their individual content calendars and campaign data.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to ensure that only the respective user and authorized team members can modify or access their content plans and campaign materials.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "social_media_management" directory to maintain an organized file structure and remove any directories no longer in use.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort the campaign and post files in a directory by size or modification date and list the files based on their size or most recent updates.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest campaign files to help identify large ad campaign files or outdated content plans that need updating.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., text files, image files, video files) in the "social_media_management" directory to streamline the management of multimedia content.
2. Filter and list content files based on their type (e.g., only images or video files) to facilitate easier content preparation and post scheduling.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "social_media_management" directory into a single archive file for easy backup and storage of all campaign data and content.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure that all relevant files (campaign logs, content plans, post schedules) are included in the backup.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
