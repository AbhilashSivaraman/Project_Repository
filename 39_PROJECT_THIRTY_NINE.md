# Server Management for Personalised content data

---

### **Directory Creation & Organization:**

1. Create a directory named "personalized_content_data".
2. Inside "personalized_content_data", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a month (e.g., "January", "February", etc.).
3. Inside each monthâ€™s directory, create files that store personalized content data (e.g., "user_interaction_day_1.txt", "content_feedback_day_1.csv").

---

### **Move and Rename Files:**

1. Move a content file (e.g., "user_interaction_day_1.txt") from one month's directory to another (e.g., from "January" to "February").
2. Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "content_feedback_day_1.csv" to "content_feedback_day_1_updated.csv") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

---

### **Navigation & Listing Files:**

1. Navigate to the "personalized_content_data" directory.
2. List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all month directories (e.g., "January", "February", etc.) and the personalized content files created in the previous task.

---

### **File Permissions Management:**

1. Create a file named "personalized_content_config.txt" in the "personalized_content_data" directory.
2. Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
3. Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

---

### **Backup Files:**

1. Create a backup of a content file (e.g., "user_interaction_day_1.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
2. Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

---

### **Removing Files & Directories:**

1. Delete one of the content files in the "personalized_content_data" directory (e.g., delete "user_interaction_day_1.txt").
2. Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the months' directories (e.g., remove the "March" directory if it's empty).

---

### **Creating a Script for File Generation:**

1. Write a script that creates 100 personalized content files inside the "personalized_content_data" directory, with each file representing a unique user interaction log or content feedback (e.g., "user_interaction_1.txt", "content_feedback_2.csv").

---

### **Exploring File History:**

1. View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
2. Search the history for any command related to user interaction data or content manipulation.

---

### **System Monitoring:**

1. Check the system's uptime to ensure the personalized content server is running smoothly without interruptions.
2. View the system's load and resource usage statistics to verify the server can handle high traffic and personalization processes efficiently.

---

### **Checking File Ownership and Permissions:**

1. Check the ownership and group of the "personalized_content_config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for managing configuration files related to personalized content.

---

### **Ping Test & Network Verification:**

1. Verify network connectivity by pinging external services the personalized content server interacts with (e.g., content delivery platforms, recommendation engines).
2. Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the server and external services.

---

### **Search for Specific Files or Content:**

1. Search for a specific content file within the "personalized_content_data" directory by its name (e.g., search for "user_interaction_day_15.txt").
2. Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "content preference update") inside one of the content feedback files in the directory.

---

### **Create a Directory for Each User:**

1. Create a directory for each user interacting with the personalized content server (e.g., "user_1", "user_2") and assign appropriate permissions for storing personalized content data and feedback.

---

### **Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:**

1. Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "personalized_content_data" directory to ensure the file structure stays organized and that unused directories are removed.

---

### **File Sorting & Management:**

1. Sort content files in the "personalized_content_data" directory by size, and then list the files based on their size to identify large user interaction logs or content data.
2. Create a report listing the largest and smallest content files in the directory to help optimize storage management.

---

### **File Type Identification:**

1. Identify and list content files of a specific type (e.g., .txt, .csv) used for storing user interactions, content preferences, or feedback in the "personalized_content_data" directory.

---

### **File Compression and Archive:**

1. Compress the "personalized_content_data" directory into a single archive file for backup purposes.
2. Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all the necessary user interaction logs, content feedback, and configuration files.

### NOTE: Finally fetch all the project commands from history and create a detailed project report "your_name_rollname.md" and push it to git your git repository
